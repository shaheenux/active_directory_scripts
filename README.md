# 🛡️ AD-Security-Toolkit

A centralized collection of automation scripts designed for **Active Directory (AD)** environments and Windows endpoint security. This repository serves as a toolkit for administrators and security researchers to audit identities and verify system compliance.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
The scripts within this toolkit are engineered to address critical areas of domain security:

* **Identity Auditing:** Analyzing user accounts, group memberships, and administrative privileges to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Credential Management:** Monitoring password lifecycles, aging, and rotation health across the environment.
* **Compliance & Reporting:** Generating structured data logs (CSV/Text) to document the security state for audits or management reviews.
* **System Hardening:** Identifying dormant or misconfigured objects that increase the attack surface of the network.

## 🚀 Design Principles
* **Safety First:** Scripts are built with a non-destructive, read-only approach by default to ensure stability in production environments.
* **Portability:** Optimized for PowerShell and modern Windows environments with minimal dependencies.
* **Transparency:** All automation provides detailed console feedback and persistent logging for every action performed.

**Developed for efficiency.** *Secure the identity, secure the network.*
